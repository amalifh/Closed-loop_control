# Closed-loop_control application
A closed-loop control application implemented on a ESP32, using FreeRTOS for real-time scheduling. Wanting to control a servo-motor bu adjusting the PWM output to target position applied by a potentiometer and is then read by an ADC. Then having a PID controller to adjust the duty cycle of the PWN to maintain the simulated position.
